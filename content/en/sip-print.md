## IP PBX Call Recording

CALL RECORDING FOR:

Whatever the size of your organization - from a small professional corporation to a large enterprise - you chose to deploy a VoIP communications system for the capital and operational cost savings and the productivity advantages for your users. Now you are looking to add a call recording option to your system to either address legal mandates or increase operational effectiveness.

But what you find are simplistic PC-based handset tools or expensive choices that require complex integration, significant maintenance and specialized IT support. Until now...

SIP Print call recording is just like your phone system: easy to install, easy to operate and easy to afford. Three versions are available, allowing for efficient scalability. All offer enterprise-class call recording performance for training, Q/A, compliance or regulatory purposes at the corporate, branch or small office level.

With the ability to record advanced functions like voicemail and “follow-me” calls forwarded to mobile phones or off-premise phone numbers, SIP Print shows the expandability and value of IP standards.
